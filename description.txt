[h2]What this mod does:[/h2]
This mod obfuscates the information that the character you are playing [u] isn't expected to know [/u] like stats of an unknown character or exact chances for schemes, etc. This takes away the feeling of omniscience and delivers a more challenging and roleplay driven experience, more consistent with the game setting.

[h2] Why this mod? [/h2]
The fact that the player is omniscient (knows every single detail about the world and the characters on it) starting to make the game feel tedious for me. So I decided to make this mod with a more roleplaying experience in mind. Although I started creating this mod for myself, while I was working on it I thought that more people would enjoy it and so I decided to upload it. hen, after positive feedback and appreciation for this mod, I decided to continue expanding it. Months have passed and, with some ideas of my own and also thanks to the feedback I receive, I keep enhancing the mod (I hope) always with the same goal in mind: Roleplaying. 
As I stated in response to the first comments when I first uploaded this mod, I never intended to make any money from it, but lately some people have been asking if they can donate or why don't I set up an account for donations. 

Here it is:

[b]This mod must be [u]last[/u] on load order [/b]
This mod is expected to be FULLY compatible with mods that only add flavour like RICE, etc
