game_concept_reflect_their_opinion: "#e Reflect Their Opinion#!"
game_concept_reflect_their_opinion_desc: "The expression of [over_12_years_old|E] characters portraits on main view will reflect their opinion on the player.\nSince face expressions on small portraits in lists would be difficult to check, those portraits will have the glow match their opinion about the player (Useful if you disable opinions and enable expressions)\n\nIf the option for face expressions to be based on opinion AND personality is enabled, characters with very low honorable personalities (Treacheous, Blackguard) will have always the same expression, regardless of their opinion of the player so the player can't "read them". Their small portrait will not change but you can enable the option for glow on portraits to match character opinions.\n\n\n#X Note: Although most do, there are very few graphics that don't have a certain expression animation available, defaulting to an idle expression#!"

game_concept_rumours: "#e Rumours#!"
game_concept_rumours_desc: "Within the world, a character's actions, traits, or demeanor may draw attention and become the subject of intriguing gossip. Rumors can spread about characters you haven't even met. Some rumors may carry neutral information, while others might have adverse effects. But keep in mind, rumors can be a mix of truths, exaggerations, or outright falsehoods. Rumors about rulers might be founded on their hidden secrets, and even a seemingly straightforward rumor could hint at the existence of a secret connected to it. And remember, even you, as a ruler, can find yourself amid the whispers of courtiers. The likelihood of negative rumors spreading increases with the number of rivals the character has."

game_concept_skill_masking: "#e mask skills#!"
game_concept_skill_masking_desc: "Upon meeting new characters, their skill values may appear higher or lower than they truly are for a period of time.\nThis perception is not random since it is influenced by your own personality, education, and skills, as well as the character's demeanor and abilities. The intrigue factor also plays a role in this dynamic.\n\nHowever, if you possess a higher education than the character in a specific area, you will never be deceived or perceive their skill incorrectly in that domain. Nonetheless, some characters with modest personalities may still be underestimated, leading you to perceive their skills as less than they truly are."

game_concept_meta_traits: "#e Meta traits#!"
game_concept_meta_traits_desc: "Meta traits are traits, apart from personality traits, whose presence in a character cannot be objectively confirmed in real life.

game_concept_intel_network: "#e Intel Network#!"
game_concept_intel_network_desc: "The Intel Network represents the ability to gather and maintain information across the land. Here's how it works:\n\n-The network expands naturally over time for #BOL adult capable#! rulers, provided a #BOL Spymaster#! is assigned to oversee it. Without a Spymaster, agents lose their crucial liaison with your court, causing the network to gradually deteriorate and eventually disband.\n\n-The development and coverage of the network are influenced by the ruler's skills, rank, the realm's stability (for example, wars may hinder the network), and your spymaster’s skills like intrigue, education, lifestyle, and personality traits. For instance, a diligent and sociable Spymaster excels at building connections, while a shy or lazy one may struggle. Speaking multiple languages is also invaluable for effective networking.\n\n-In the council, you can halt development to pause growth while maintaining existing coverage and expenses (however, circumstances like your Spymaster leaving or illness may still impact it) or dismantle the network entirely if priorities shift.\n\n-Expenditure for network development and maintenance can be adjusted, balancing costs with growth. Your steward skill will affect this expenditure"

game_concept_ask_advisors: "#e Requesting military advice#!"
game_concept_ask_advisors_desc: "Since military strength information for characters that are not your vassals is not readily available to you, there is a button located in the character window, in the place where the military strength details are normally displayed, with which you can ask your advisors for an estimation of a character's military might.\n\nThe accuracy of this advice depends on your Marshal's skill, personality, and your own [martial|E] skill. Your Marshal’s advice could be influenced by factors such as loyalty, bias, and personal motivations. The advice will also be much more accurate for neigboring rulers\n\n -#clickable Overconfidence or Arrogance:#!
