spy_ongoing.1002.opening: "To the esteemed and noble [councillor_liege.GetTitledFirstName],"
spy_ongoing.1002.desc:0 "I trust that your reputation and legacy are of great importance to you, as they are to all wise rulers. It is with this understanding that I felt compelled to pen this letter, as I have come into possession of certain knowledge that, should it fall upon the ears of the wrong person, would perhaps tarnish the good name you have so diligently cultivated. \n\nIndeed, it is most unfortunate, for you, that whispers of your interest in the affairs of [target_character.GetTitledFirstName] have not gone unnoticed. "
spy_ongoing.1002.drunkard:"It seems your [your_spy.GetTitledFirstName] has a fondness for drink, a habit that has loosened their tongue one too many times in rather unsavory company. A careless word here, a drunken jest there—it is remarkable how even the sharpest of secrets can slip through in a haze of ale and laughter."
spy_ongoing.1002.contrite:"Much of this came to light through none other than your own spymaster, [your_spy.GetTitledFirstName], a soul who suffers from a tender and uneasy conscience, often burdened with a need to confess matters that most would leave unsaid. Their contrition betrays you, for in their remorse, they have shared more than was wise, more than you might wish known."
spy_ongoing.1002.unintelligent:"Word of your endeavor reached me quite easily, owing to the, shall we say, deficiencies of [your_spy.GetTitledFirstName]. A shrewd individual might have covered your tracks with greater care, yet your current agent's loose tongue and unrefined methods have laid bare secrets that ought to remain hidden."
spy_ongoing.1002.low_skill:"The fault lies in the ineptitude of [your_spy.GetTitledFirstName]. [your_spy.GetHerHis] clumsy attempts at subterfuge have betrayed your intentions, drawing curious eyes and setting tongues to wag. Even the most subtle of intrigues cannot remain hidden if handled by hands unskilled in the craft."
spy_ongoing.1002.closing: "\n\nShould these rumors find their way to [target_character.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] court one can only imagine the consequences. And a ruler embroiled in such underhanded schemes is rarely seen as just or honorable.\n\nBut, fret not, for I am not without mercy. If you wish to keep this knowledge hidden, attached to this letter are instructions to satisfy my silence. Your reputation and secrecy are within your grasp, if you have the wisdom to act accordingly.\n\nI shall await your hasty response."
