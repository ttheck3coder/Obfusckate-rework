mod_features.0001.t:"#clickable obfusCKate#! Overview and Features"
mod_features.0001.desc:"#E Please note that this is meant to provide a general overview of the mod's mechanics and features. It won't delve deeply into the underlying logic of its implementation except where relevant. So, if you find yourself wondering things like #EMP "Why can't I see the portrait of my newborn nephews?"#! or feeling frustrated with issues like #EMP "I can't find a genius, beautiful, high-skilled spouse for my heir!"#!, feel free to reach out—I’ll be happy to address any questions or concerns. But try to ask yourself:\n#high #EMP "Was my character really supposed to know?"#!#!#!\n\nYou are playing with a mod that dynamically alters how information is presented to align with what your character realistically knows.\nSo, here’s an introduction to how it works:\n\n#clickable #EMP • Wait, do I need to read this?!#!#! Not necessarily! The mod’s mechanics are seamlessly integrated into the game. You can just play as usual without needing to take additional steps.\n#clickable #EMP • Why should I read this, then?#!#! By reading this, you’ll gain a better understanding of the mod’s mechanics and features and how to effectively use them. With this knowledge, you can enhance both your strategy and immersion in the game.\n#clickable #EMP • Does it make the game harder?#!#! Not exactly #EMP harder#!, but definitely #BOL more challenging and roleplay-focused#! by emphasizing a more grounded, realistic experience, making decisions feel weightier and more rewarding.\n#clickable #EMP • Does the AI have access to the information?#!#! Yes, it has full access to the information, as it always has. Restricting the AI further would serve no purpose.#!\n#clickable #EMP • Well, then how does it work?#!#! The core idea is simple: information that your character #X isn’t supposed to know#! is #BOL hidden#!. Instead of always having omniscient knowledge, details are gradually revealed #BOL dynamically#!, based on your character’s actions and circumstances like interactions, schemes, council tasks, activities and an Intel Network that expands your reach."  
mod_features.0001.a: "Humm, interesting... Tell me more."
mod_features.0001.b: "Enough! I have used mods before!"

mod_features.0002.t:"Flow of information"
mod_features.0002.desc:"The flow of information mirrors real-life dynamics, considering both the #BOL closeness#! and the #BOL length#! of the relationship, as well as the #BOL personality#! of the character your player character interacts with.\n\n#clickable #EMP • Family First:#!#! Your closest family are deeply familiar to you, with their details always remembered. After all, they’re part of your bloodline and daily life.\n#clickable #EMP • Other Relations:#!#! You will naturally know details about your friends, rivals, and lovers, as well as some aspects of their closest connections. However, the depth of this knowledge varies—while you may know the intimate details of a lover’s life, a rival might require further observation or investigation. Different levels of knowledge reflect the strength and nature of these relationships, adding depth and nuance to your interactions.\n#clickable #EMP • Gradual Discovery:#!#! You’ll learn about others through direct interaction, schemes, or observation. Characters you’ve met only once, like a courtier at a feast, may quickly fade into obscurity unless they remain significant to your story. A famous monarch’s deeds, and lineage will be widely known, while obscure lords or minor dynasties might remain a mystery unless you interact or someone tells you about them. Prominent rulers and renowned dynasties will naturally stand out.\n\nThis system tries to create a dynamic sense of realism: you know what your character reasonably should, and you’ll discover more as events unfold. Relationships deepen naturally, adding new layers of immersion to your roleplay experience." 
mod_features.0002.a: "And what information is hidden?"
mod_features.0002.b: "Enough! Let me play!"

mod_features.0003.t:"Information availability"
mod_features.0003.desc:"At its core, everything about a character—except their name—is unknown. The visibility of details is influenced by your player character's #BOL relational proximity#!, the #BOL duration#! of your acquaintance, the #BOL frequency and depth#! of interactions, and the #BOL character's personality#!.\n#weak Information availability can be adjusted via the game rules.#!\n\nBelow is a general outline of how information is revealed, with its #BOL #high nuances#!#! described in another section\n#clickable #EMP • Well-known characters:#!#! Family members, courtiers, vassals, and other close relations are naturally familiar to your character.\n#clickable #EMP • Characters known to some extent:#!#! Recently arrived guests or courtiers, relations of your relations, or those involved in recent more in depth interactions.\n#clickable #EMP • Barely known characters:#!#! Figures your character might have briefly encountered, spied on, or heard of, such as kings, emperors, or other famous individuals or even someone with whom your character interacted briefly (a casual compliment at a feast).\n#clickable #EMP • Unknown characters:#!#! Everyone else, because really, #EMP #high why would King Harold II know anything about Count Random of Somewheria or any of his guests like Erratikos Purposelessios?#!#!\n#clickable #EMP • What other information is obscured?#!#! Most details that should be uncertain or concealed are presented as estimates or hidden entirely, rather than exact values. This includes exact opinion values, county and province statistics, interaction acceptance chances and reasons, event outcomes, scheme success rates and secrecy. After all, #EMP assassin cyborgs calculating #high "there is a 27% chance to murder Duke Disposable"#! were notably absent in the Middle Ages#!. Similarly, faction plans remain undisclosed—because, let’s be honest, #EMP #high "Hey liege, I'm gathering some folks to overthrow you!"#! is not a typical announcement... or is it?#!\n\nAnyway, to ease the burden of looking through lists of unknown characters, there is a small fading icon on the bottom center right, near the game date bar, that opens a list featuring #BOL #high only #!#!#high #L People you know#!#!" 
mod_features.0003.a: "You mentioned #EMP nuances#!. Just what nuances are those?"
mod_features.0003.b: "Tell me again about the information flow."
mod_features.0003.c: "I really want to play!"

mod_features.0004.t:"Nuances and game rules"
mod_features.0004.desc:"Not all information is equally accessible or easily revealed.\n\n#clickable #EMP • Close proximity doesn’t guarantee deep knowledge#!#!: For instance, someone who is introverted may remain an enigma even if you interact with them frequently.\n#clickable #EMP • Some people reveal too much too soon#!#!: A brief encounter with an arrogant character might see them boasting about their wealth or alliances, while extroverted and bold individuals could share personal details, such as their sexual preferences, without hesitation. Irrational characters are unpredictable and might disclose almost anything to anyone.\n#clickable #EMP • Limitations of your character’s perception#!#!: If your player character is incapable or a child, they may fail to make sense of even the most overt disclosures. For instance, one can hardly imagine a child recognizing someone as a #EMP "Fearless Blackguard"#! or a #EMP "Content Planner"#! even if the person’s behavior makes it obvious.\n#clickable #EMP • Sensitive or concealed information#!#!: Details like wealth, military strength, political connections, or sexuality are harder to uncover compared to easily inferred traits like visible skills or professions (e.g., recognizing a physician).\n#clickable #EMP • Are there 'invisible' traits?#!#! Yes! [meta_traits|E] such as 'fertile' or 'genius' are not visible unless explicitly enabled in the game rules. Similarly, children’s personality traits remain hidden unless enabled.\n#clickable #EMP • What about 'visible' skills?#!#! Character's skills (except yours) are not shown as exact values but rather as more or less accurate approximations, depending on your level of proximity with the character, with some characters being able to [skill_masking|E], intentionally or not, so #EMP ponder before appointing that newly arrived courtier with high diplomacy as your new chancellor#!. This is another adjustable rule.\n#clickable #EMP • Customize what’s visible in the game rules.#!#!: You can adjust settings to control the visibility of features mentioned above as well as portraits, opinions, opinion breakdowns, and personality traits for all characters. Keep in mind that incapable or child characters do not have active opinions."
mod_features.0004.a: "So, how do I get to know people?"
mod_features.0004.b: "Tell me again what information is obscured." 
mod_features.0004.c: "I can't endure this any longer!"

mod_features.0005.t:"Getting information"
mod_features.0005.desc:"#EMP You get to know people by going out to have a drink or something... err, well, sort of, but not only.#! Information can be gathered through a variety of strategies and resources, whether by direct contact, overheard gossip, or deliberate information transfer—be it commissioned or obtained through #EMP persuasion#! (using the term loosely here).\nAs the saying goes, #EMP "What you see (or hear) is what you get"#!. Meeting someone in person will reveal their physical appearance, in contrast to second-hand information where details about traits might be conveyed but their exact physical features remain unknown. After all, just because someone says Gimli is a dwarf, you can't conjure up every detail of his face...but you will know for a fact that he is a dwarf. This makes sense, #high since photographs and internet-based social networks didn’t exist in the Middle Ages.#! #weak (although rulers’ likenesses might be spread via currency, for example)#!\n\n#clickable #EMP • Activities#!#! like attending feasts, weddings, universities, or going on tours allow your character to forge new connections or strengthen existing ones.\n#clickable #EMP • Schemes#!#! like Befriend, Romance, Seduce, or Sway offer a way to build relationships. However, these have been rebalanced with new, more realistic rules for targets—#EMP you won’t be seducing a random courtier halfway across the world who has never heard of you, nor wasting time swaying an unremarkable character through empty correspondence#!.\n#clickable #EMP • Interactions,#!#! either previously existing ones or those new (hover to get details) like the ones below: \n\n-[send_emissary|e]\n\n-[ask_guest_info|E]\n\n-[ask_advisors|E]\n\n-[request_mil_info|E]\n\n-[interrogate_prisoner|E]\n\n#clickable #EMP • Covert Operations#!#! are only available for landed player characters and include:\n- Tasking your spymaster to find secrets, which not only seeks out secrets but also gradually builds a detailed profile of the characters in the target court. The success and secrecy of this mission heavily depend on your spymaster’s abilities and traits.\n\n- Relying on your [intel_network|E], where your network’s reach and coverage allow you to request basic or more detailed reports on a character. These reports provide valuable insights but are limited to the scope and depth of your network.\n\n#L Both actions#! have the potential to uncover sensitive information such as military strength, wealth, dishonorable vassals plotting against you in factions, or even a character's sexuality. However, only the Find Secrets task can reveal actual secrets. #weak This distinction ensures balance by not providing the player with an extra tool, as the AI only has access to the find secrets task and does not rely on an intel network.#!\n\n#clickable #EMP • Some decisions or occasional events#!#!\n- [rumours|E]: you will be frequently notified about gossips regarding various characters. This is another way that you can get hints about some interesting characters.\n\n- The #high Find Spouse decision#! and the #high Find a Marriage Candidate interaction#! are designed to assist you in finding a suitable spouse for your player character or, in the case of the latter, for one of your heirs. By nominating a herald to act on your behalf, they will seek candidates they deem suitable based on their stance towards you. While the primary purpose of these actions isn't gathering information, some unknown details about #EMP potential spouse candidates#! will naturally be uncovered during the process.\nIn case you feel frustrated because #EMP #high you can't find a suitable character to marry#!#!, remember that in the Middle Ages, marriage was primarily a means to an end—most often securing alliances—rather than a union based on emotional or physical connection. Many couples only met their betrothed on the day of the wedding. The concept of betrothal, where individuals were promised to each other early in life, highlights this dynamic, with personal compatibility playing little to no role in the arrangement."
mod_features.0005.a: "Is there anything more I should know?"
mod_features.0005.b: "Tell me again about the nuances of information availability." 
mod_features.0005.c: "Oh, god..."

mod_features.0006.t:"Wrap Up"
mod_features.0006.desc:" • As previously mentioned #clickable #EMP county statistics are not visible#!#! but they may be revealed, either automatically by your [intel_network|E] or, if you are playing as a landless adventurer, by visiting settlements. Your character will remember the information of recently visited settlements for some time.\n\n • When your player character dies, #clickable #EMP its heir will inherit#!#! some information, but not all, from the acquaintances of your previous character. Also, every playing character, including your heir, always starts with a more or less developed [intel_network|E], as if it was naturally being developed since said character became an adult. Obviously, the development of this network will depend on the character's age, traits and skills, as well as those of its spymaster. So, expect intrigue focused characters to start with a more developed network when compared to others\n\n • There is a #clickable #EMP Personal Identity Discovery Decision#!#! that allows you to set your character's sexual orientation every 25 years. This can be disabled in the game rules\n\n • You might have noticed a small #clickable #EMP fading button with a treble clef#!#! near your wealth display on the top of the hud. Its only purpose it's to open the playlist quickly with a single click\n\n • This mod was designed with #clickable #EMP fun, balance, challenge, consistency, and roleplaying#!#! in mind, aiming to make the most of character traits and skills in gameplay. As such, skills and traits are intentionally made #BOL impactful#! across decisions, actions, and interactions. Keep this in mind when appointing councilors or assigning them to tasks, as their abilities and personalities can significantly influence outcomes.\n\n • Finally, this mod works by flagging characters so, if you intentionally switch to another character in the middle of a playthrough, your new character will mantain the knowledge gathered by your previous character, which might not feel natural. There is an interaction only available if your character becomes incapable. It's the #high Switch Character#! interaction which allows you to change your character and removes the flags of the characters your previous player character knew\n\n#clickable #BOL •  •  •  Have fun! This mod was designed for it •  •  •  #!#!"

mod_features.0006.b: "At last!"
